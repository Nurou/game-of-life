[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) implemented in JavaScript using test-driven development (TDD).

The program takes as input a run-length encoded (RLE) pattern file (for the initial pattern) and the number of iterations the game should perform. The resulting pattern is outputted in RLE format.
